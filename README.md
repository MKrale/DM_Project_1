This Repository contains the following:

1) A .pdf file of the report written for the Report of the project Data Mining;
2) Five .py files containing the code used to get these results discussed in this report;
3) A directory 'toolbox' containing helper functions used in the above code;
4) Two ziped directory of 'Filtered Data'. This is the output of the code 'ReadFiles.py', and can be used to recreate all results in the above report.

With this, all python files (except 'ReadFiles.py) should be runnable without any alterations, except by chaning the 'here'-variable to the correct path on your pc. All settings can be configured at the top of each file.

Note: when trying to cluster data, make sure you have already run 'FindPCAs.py' for the settings you want to use!
